# odd-even-numbers
enter a whole number and display if it's even or odd

Instructions:
We want to have a Java program that differentiates between an even and an odd number. To do this, follow these steps:
- Create a Java class named "CollectNbr"
- Add a constructor that gives the ability to create an object with a single value of integer type.
- Add a CheckNumber(int n) method that allows you to differentiate between a odd and even number, while adding a means of displaying results.
- Test the program in the main method, to create objects through the constructor.
- Adapt the program to do the automatic completion of whole numbers through the Scanner class
